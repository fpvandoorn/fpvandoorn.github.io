## About me

I am a professor at the [mathematical institute](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/) of the [university of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de) and leading the workgroup Formal Mathematics. My interest is to make it viable to formalize research mathematics in *proof assistants* that can check the correctness of such proofs for you. Currently, it still takes a lot of work to write the proof down in great details.

I am mainly working using the [Lean Theorem Prover](https://leanprover.github.io/), and I am a maintainer of its mathematical library [mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/). Projects that I've done include:
* The [Carleson project](https://florisvandoorn.com/carleson/), proving [Carleson's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleson%27s_theorem) generalized to doubling metric measure spaces.
* I contributed to the [formalization of the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Conjecture](https://teorth.github.io/pfr/).
* The [sphere eversion project](https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/), formalizing Gromov's h-principle and concluding the existence of an eversion of a sphere.
* The [Flypitch project](https://flypitch.github.io/), formalizing the independence of the continuum hypothesis.
* The [Spectral sequences project](https://github.com/cmu-phil/Spectral), formalizing the (cohomological) Serre spectral sequence using synthetic homotopy theory. This was written on top of [the HoTT library for Lean 2](https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/hott/hott.md).

To learn Lean, try out the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/hhu-adam/NNG4) or read the online book [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/). There are also [other ways of learning Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html).

I am interested in formalized mathematics, tools and automation for formalization and (homotopy) type theory. I also enjoy thinking about [combinatorial problems](https://github.com/fpvandoorn/Dagstuhl-tables/), solving puzzles and playing board games and video games. I have some [tips](files/BonnPC.md) on configuring some things for the office computers in Bonn.

### Short CV

* 2023 - present: Professor at the University of Bonn
* 2021 - 2023: Postdoc at the [mathematics department](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/) of the [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), working with [Patrick Massot](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~pmassot/en/).
* 2018 - 2021: Postdoc at the [mathematics department](http://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/) of the University of Pittsburgh, working with [Tom Hales](https://sites.google.com/site/thalespitt/) on the [Formal Abstracts](https://formalabstracts.github.io/) and [Flypitch](https://flypitch.github.io/) projects.
* 2013-2018: PhD at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/index.html) under the supervision of [Jeremy Avigad](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/) and [Steve Awodey](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/). My **dissertation** is titled *["On the Formalization of Higher Inductive Types and Synthetic Homotopy Theory"](papers/dissertation.pdf)*.

See also my [full CV (pdf)](files/cv.pdf).

<!-- I formalize mathematical results and develop new tools for the [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) Theorem prover. I am a contributor and maintainer of [mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/). I have formalized results from many areas of mathematics, including measure theory, set theory, model theory, and combinatorics. Together with [Jesse Michael Han](https://jesse-michael-han.github.io/), I formalized the independence of the continuum hypothesis in the [Flypitch project](https://flypitch.github.io/), which was one of the few remaining unformalized problems on [Freek Wiedijk's list](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/). The proof required formalizing an internal model of set theory in Lean and formalizing a notion of forcing. We used Boolean-valued forcing for our proof.

I also formalized another problem on Wiedijk's list, proving that it is impossible to partition a cube into finitely many smaller cubes. Recently, I have formalized quite some measure theory, including the Haar measure and Fubini's theorem for the Bochner integral. I have furthermore worked on various tactics, tools, and programs to aid formalization in Lean.

I am interested in [Homotopy Type Theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/) (HoTT), which is a connection between homotopy theory and type theory, where one interprets the basic concepts in the logic of type theory in a geometric way. Using this interpretation, you can define many concepts of algebraic topology, like homotopy and (co)homology groups synthetically into the type theory. Since the homotopy theoretic definitions are very close to the logical foundations, it is feasible to formalize many of these results in a proof assistant, without being much more effort than proving these results on paper. I have formalized a lot of Homotopy Type Theory in [the HoTT library for Lean 2](https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/hott/hott.md) and in the [Spectral Sequence project](https://github.com/cmu-phil/Spectral), where I was the main author of both. My main interest in this field is *synthetic homotopy theory*, which is the study of types as spaces in algebraic topology. My main contribution was to give a synthetic definition of the (cohomological) Serre and Atiyah-Hirzebruch Spectral sequences in Lean.

I have also studied the research question of which higher inductive types can be constructed from ordinary inductive types and one simple higher inductive type, the homotopy pushout. -->
